In this project, our main goal was to create a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient being affected by diabetes. 
The project was divided into several crucial phases, each contributing to the overall success of the system.
During the production phase, we dedicated time to data preprocessing, ensuring that the data was properly cleaned and ready for model training.
 Next, we focused on training the model using techniques to maximize accuracy and reliability in predictions. 
Finally, we conducted thorough testing to evaluate the model's performance and ensure it was ready for deployment.
A key aspect of our project was the development of a dashboard and data app, enabling an interactive visualization of the model's output. 
This allowed us to present results in a clear and accessible manner, making it easy for users to interact with the system. 
Additionally, we implemented a feature that allows users to input their personal data, providing them with a personalized prediction based on their own situation.
We are incredibly proud of the outcome achieved in this project, which led us to secure the second place in the Knime challenge 2022. 
This recognition confirmed the effectiveness and validity of our machine learning model, 
showcasing our commitment to delivering innovative and accurate solutions in the field of healthcare and diabetes prediction.
