## Progetto Tesi

You can find the report relating to the three-year thesis. It is a project referring to the comparison of some Machine Learning models, of which the best one, used to support an investment strategy

## World Cup 2022 Sentiment Analysis

This project consists of two parts.
The first concerns the entire data acquisition process:

the statistics of each match of the World Cup played in Qatar in 2022, and the ranking of the teams in the moment immediately before and after it were obtained via scraping from the official fifa website. Furthermore, through a special library, the tweets for each game were acquired on which a sentiment analysis was then carried out to understand the thoughts of the users and what could have the most influence.

The second part talks about visualizing this data, trying to answer the questions posed initially.
You have an interactive visualization by following the dashboards of the link below.

## How data can affect Football

It is a simple R markdown done to demonstrate how data analysis is an increasingly important element in any field. It was a first approach to the world of R for the Probability and statistics course, useful above all to be able to understand the relationships between variables

## Coco captioning
In the context of the project, the Coco dataset, a large collection of annotated images, was used to address the captioning problem. Captioning involves providing a meaningful textual description for each image in the dataset. 
To achieve this goal, a combination of advanced deep learning techniques was adopted.
Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was utilized to automatically extract salient features from the images. 
The CNN demonstrated a high capacity for learning visual structures,  enabling the encoding of image signals into a format understandable by the captioning system. Subsequently, for text generation, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was employed.
 RNNs are well-suited for handling sequential data and were used to decode the features extracted by the CNN into a coherent and meaningful sequence of words, thus composing the complete image description.
The approach of using a combination of CNN and RNN proved effective in tackling the captioning challenge, allowing the system to provide image descriptions with good semantic coherence and an understanding  of the visual relationships present in the photographed scenes.

## Diabetes prediction
In this project, our main goal was to create a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient being affected by diabetes. 
The project was divided into several crucial phases, each contributing to the overall success of the system.
During the production phase, we dedicated time to data preprocessing, ensuring that the data was properly cleaned and ready for model training.
 Next, we focused on training the model using techniques to maximize accuracy and reliability in predictions. 
Finally, we conducted thorough testing to evaluate the model's performance and ensure it was ready for deployment.
A key aspect of our project was the development of a dashboard and data app, enabling an interactive visualization of the model's output. 
This allowed us to present results in a clear and accessible manner, making it easy for users to interact with the system. 
Additionally, we implemented a feature that allows users to input their personal data, providing them with a personalized prediction based on their own situation.
We are incredibly proud of the outcome achieved in this project, which led us to secure the second place in the Knime challenge 2022. 
This recognition confirmed the effectiveness and validity of our machine learning model, 
showcasing our commitment to delivering innovative and accurate solutions in the field of healthcare and diabetes prediction.
Furthermore, we have been given the opportunity to publish our paper on Medium. This opportunity has excited us greatly as Medium is a widely popular content sharing platform, allowing us to reach a broad audience of readers interested in the field of Data Science and diabetes prediction
