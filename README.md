## ML applied to financial business

Artificial intelligence is increasingly evolving in all sectors of the modern world. Thanks to Machine Learning, many predictive analyses become simpler and more accurate. In this experiment, 6 Machine Learning algorithms (Arima, SVR, Linear Regression, KNN Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor) and 3 Deep Learning algorithms (ANN, GRU, LSTM) will be utilized for stock price prediction, comparing them and demonstrating that neural networks, particularly ANN in this case, are most suitable for complex tasks requiring extensive data. All of this aims to support an investment strategy, which proves to be advantageous but falls short of the predictions.

## World Cup 2022 Sentiment Analysis

Football is undoubtedly one of the most widely followed sports worldwide, with millions of fans across all continents, representing a culturally significant phenomenon on a global scale. The 2022 Qatar World Cup marks a significant turning point in this sport. For the first time, a Middle Eastern country hosted the highest-level football competition, symbolizing the ongoing growth in this region.

Despite all the controversy surrounding the preparation of this sporting event, it is estimated that the World Cup final was watched by approximately 1.5 billion people. This figure contradicts the statements of some football experts in recent years, who argue that matches are becoming less interesting due to the technical imbalance between top-tier teams and emerging ones, leading to "boring" games. This perception has even prompted consideration of a revolution in the sport through the Super League project, primarily advocated by Florentino Perez, president of Real Madrid, who claims that young people between the ages of 14 and 24 are abandoning football because they find it boring compared to other forms of entertainment they prefer.

The purpose of the project is to answer the question of what variables impact people's opinions. This will be achieved by comparing the key statistics of the 64 matches played in the 2022 Qatar World Cup with sentiment analysis of tweets related to these matches. The choice of Twitter is due to the fact that internationally, 75% of users are under 30 years old. To assess the technical level of national teams and verify its impact, the latest official team rankings as of October 6, 2022, have been considered.

Data visualization plays a crucial role in this analysis, as it allows us to visually represent the events in an
intuitive format. Through the use of various charts techniques, we aim to shed light on the performance of
the teams, the mood of the fans, and the overall sentiment towards the event. By exploring the
relationships between the various data points, we hope to uncover patterns and insights that would
otherwise remain hidden.
The results of our analysis provide a perspective on the World Cup and offer new insights into the
tournament and its impact with the purpose of answering the following questions: how did people react to
one of the most watched events in the world? Is there a relationship between match statistics and user
sentiments?

## How data can affect Football

Football is one of the most popular themes in Italy and in the world. Few people don’t have a
favorite team or at least don’t sympathize for anyone. In recent years various technologies have
been introduced in this sport,for example VAR and goal line technology. Furthermore, the use of
data for the analysis of individual or team performances is increasingly developing, just think of
the De Bruyne case, thanks to a team of data scientists managed to obtain an increase in his
contract renewal. with this experiment I will try to give an input of what the data can show us
about this sport. It will be used a dataset of the last 5 seasons in Serie A, it contains the dates of
the matches, the results and many other in-game statistics

## Coco captioning
In the context of the project, the Coco dataset, a large collection of annotated images, was used to address the captioning problem. Captioning involves providing a meaningful textual description for each image in the dataset. 
To achieve this goal, a combination of advanced deep learning techniques was adopted.
Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was utilized to automatically extract salient features from the images. 
The CNN demonstrated a high capacity for learning visual structures,  enabling the encoding of image signals into a format understandable by the captioning system. Subsequently, for text generation, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was employed.
 RNNs are well-suited for handling sequential data and were used to decode the features extracted by the CNN into a coherent and meaningful sequence of words, thus composing the complete image description.
The approach of using a combination of CNN and RNN proved effective in tackling the captioning challenge, allowing the system to provide image descriptions with good semantic coherence and an understanding  of the visual relationships present in the photographed scenes.

## Diabetes prediction
In this project, our main goal was to create a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a patient being affected by diabetes. 
The project was divided into several crucial phases, each contributing to the overall success of the system.
During the production phase, we dedicated time to data preprocessing, ensuring that the data was properly cleaned and ready for model training.
 Next, we focused on training the model using techniques to maximize accuracy and reliability in predictions. 
Finally, we conducted thorough testing to evaluate the model's performance and ensure it was ready for deployment.
A key aspect of our project was the development of a dashboard and data app, enabling an interactive visualization of the model's output. 
This allowed us to present results in a clear and accessible manner, making it easy for users to interact with the system. 
Additionally, we implemented a feature that allows users to input their personal data, providing them with a personalized prediction based on their own situation.
We are incredibly proud of the outcome achieved in this project, which led us to secure the second place in the Knime challenge 2022. 
This recognition confirmed the effectiveness and validity of our machine learning model, 
showcasing our commitment to delivering innovative and accurate solutions in the field of healthcare and diabetes prediction.
Furthermore, we have been given the opportunity to publish our paper on Medium. This opportunity has excited us greatly as Medium is a widely popular content sharing platform, allowing us to reach a broad audience of readers interested in the field of Data Science and diabetes prediction

## Study of the DBCV Statistical Metric for Internal Clustering in Unsupervised Machine Learning
In this project, it is explored the efficacy of the DBCV (Density-Based Cluster Validity) metric in
evaluating clustering outcomes, particularly in the context of density-based clustering methods like
HDBSCAN. Through extensive comparison with other widely-used clustering validation metrics such
as silhouette, Dunn, Davies-Bouldin, and Calinski-Harabasz, the DBCV metric demonstrated its sen-
sitivity to variations in cluster density and separation. This characteristic makes DBCV particularly
suitable for scenarios where cluster density plays a crucial role in determining clustering quality.
Overall, the DBCV metric has proven to be a valuable tool in clustering analysis, offering a nuanced
perspective that complements other validation methods. Its focus on density and cohesion provides
insights that are particularly relevant in complex clustering scenarios where traditional metrics might fall short.
